A program that's made for predicting diabetes.

# Usage
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pinkozz/diabetes-prediction
```

2. Navigate to the project folder
```bash
cd diabetes-prediction
```

3. Navigate to the react directory and install all npm packages needed
```bash
cd diabetes-prediction-react
npm i
```

4. Navigate to the project folder and install all pip packages needed
```bash

pip3 install -r diabetes-python/requirements.txt
```

5. Navigate to the react folder

cd diabetes-prediction-react
```

6. Run the react part
```bash
npm start

NOTE: At this point open new terminal (Don't close the previous one) and type all the commands there, since the react app and python app should run at the same time.

8. Navigate to the python folder
```bash
cd diabetes-python

python3 app2.py
```

Done! Now wait for the ML model to learn. Then go to the localhost:3000 and use the program.
You can test it by going to the ./diabetes-python/diabetes.csv and filling the form up with any of the test cases. You can also test it with your own data.
